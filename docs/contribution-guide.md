## How to work with GIT

- for each task you should create a feature branch (name of the branch should contain number of the issue/task)
- commit into you branch, if your work is done, push the branch
- create pull request from your branch to `master`
- every merge conflicts should be resolved before creating pull request (merge, rebase), otherwise the PR will be rejected
- every commit should have a meaningfull commit message
- squash or fixup commits with fixes of typos and so on before creating pull request
- since you will be working on feature branch alone, feel free to force push in case you've changed a history (for example after rebase)
